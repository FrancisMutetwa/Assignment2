# Program Name -\ConcurrencyAssignment2023

Welcome to the MULTITHREADED CONCURRENT CLUB SIMULATION! This program demonstrates how to utilize synchronization mechanisms to
ensure that the simulation adheres to specified synchronization constraints and maintains safety and liveness.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- java 
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository** (Skip this step if you prefer to download the code manually):
   ```bash
   https://github.com/FrancisMutetwa/Assignment2/tree/2aaef03a34fb11432ef70db6fe951e8f2e78de1b
   ```

2. **Manual Download**:
   - Download the repository as a ZIP file.
   - Extract the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the program files:
   ```bash
   cd MTTFRA005_CSC2002S_PCP1/ConcurrencyAssignment2023/ConcurrencyAssignment2023 
   ```

3. Run the program using java:
   ```bash
   make run ARGS="arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4"
   ```

4. You can open up the make file too inorder to specify the arguments that you want to enter.

5. The program will execute the arguments entered in the makefile when you run make run
6. Please note that i have modified the program such that it will only run when it is given commandline arguments as what we did in Assignment1
